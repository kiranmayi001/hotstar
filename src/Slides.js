                  pool of her blood, and Sanaya has multiple stab wounds. He leaves the
                  crime scene, but meets with an accident and is taken to the police
                  station. Initially, Madhav Mishra is interested in taking the case but
                  later on Mandira Mathur takes the case. While she is successful in

                  Mishra , also tries to save him.
